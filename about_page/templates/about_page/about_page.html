<h2>About</h2>
<p>The first question you are probably asking yourself is, "What is a JonnyJE?” Well, JonnyJE is a username I use throughout the internet. "Jonny" is my nickname and "JE" stands for my middle and last name initials. Now that that’s out of the way, I can move on to more important things like why I have my own website.</p>
<p>Back in 2006, I created my first website with a WYSIWYG editor at age 13 using a free web hosting service called freewebs (now known as <a href="https://webs.com">webs</a>). I wanted to create an environment that had my favorite interests all in one place. Coding, being one of my interests, made me want to go beyond using a WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>About after two years of being with freewebs, they went under some major changes- and not for the better. They added ads everywhere and were placing limits on certain things making it nearly impossible to have a presentable website. So, with that in mind I went on a search for a new free web host and I came upon another called <a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost</a>, where I could freely code to my desire without basically any limits.</p>
<p>In fall of that same year one of my long time internet friends, Chris helped me get the domain name JonnyJE.com. Up to this point I was (and I still am actually) using a free URL redirection service called <a href="http://freedomain.co.nr">freedomain.co.nr</a>. Now I need to pay a yearly domain name renewal fee to keep JonnyJE.com domain name mine... Please consider helping me out by donating.</p>
<p>000webhost was a fairly nice host until about Mid-March of 2010. I could not connect do my FTP server for about a month making it impossible for me to update any content. As you can imagine, that made things very frustrating. I contacted their support and all I got were some canned messages and as it seemed a different person each time. I was basically told to delete my account and there was nothing that they could do to help me.</p>
<p>After finding out 000webhost did not care one bit about their customers, I went looking yet another webhost and this time I came across a web hosting service called <a href="http://bytehost.com">bytehost</a>. The page that you are currently reading is being hosted by them and I have been happy so far with their services. I still use 000webhost for some things like the support section of my site to reduce server load, but I’m not very happy with them.</p>
<p>So after that long explanation we end up to where JonnyJE.com is today. I do not use a WYSIWYG editor anymore, as you just get way too many errors in code it generates. I coded this website in XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS 2.1 from scratch and it is error free (as you probably have seen the W3C validation on the side). I enjoy coding this website even though it may be frustrating at times. :)</p>
